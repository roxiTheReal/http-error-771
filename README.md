### Furry Context
The 771 status was first adopted by a furry web developer who wanted a more expressive way to represent the early stage of a webpage's life cycle. Instead of a generic *"under construction"*, it acknowledges that the page is already in someone's paws–just not ready to share it yet.

You might imagine a sleepy kitty curled up on the keyboard, dreaming of layout ideas and page content. This page will exist... eventually.
